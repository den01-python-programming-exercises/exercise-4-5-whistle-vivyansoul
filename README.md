# Exercise 4.5 Whistle

Create a class named `Whistle`. Add the variable `sound` to the class. After that, create the constructor `def __init__(self, whistle_sound)`, which is used to create a new whistle that's given a sound.

```python
duck_whistle = Whistle("Kvaak")
rooster_whistle = Whistle("Peef")

print(duck_whistle.sound)
print(rooster_whistle.sound)
print(duck_whistle.sound)
```

```plaintext
Kvaak
Peef
Kvaak
```
